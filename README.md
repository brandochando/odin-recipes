Odin Recipes project (p1)
Compiled the names, images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps for several recipes. These include a breakfast croissant, sushi, and shrimp scampi.

I used ordered and unordered lists for the steps and ingredients respectively.

I imbedded the images using src and linked to each individual recipe page using href.
