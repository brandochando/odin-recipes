    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A quick grab-and-go snack that can be created using leftover ham and a cheese of choice. For this recipe we will use Gruyere cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury® Grands!™)</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) ham steak, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Unroll crescent dough and separate individual rolls at perforations. Place 1 piece of ham and 1 tablespoon of Gruyere
        cheese in the center of each triangle. Fold over the 2 longer sides of the triangle, overlapping them to seal ham and
        cheese.</li>
        <li>Arrange crescents 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool completely on a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Wrap crescents individually with wax paper and place into a large resealable bag. Place in the freezer.</li>
    </ol>
